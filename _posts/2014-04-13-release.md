My 2nd mod, Luppii's Ladders has been released!

This mini-mod adds 2 new ladders and a machine:
* Rope Ladder: A ladder which works much like the vanilla Minecraft ladder, but with an exception: It only requires a solid block at the top ladder. You can place new ladders under existing rope ladders to extend down.
* Sturdy Ladder: This ladder only needs a solid block at the bottom. You can place ladders on top of each other to make a self-supporting ladder.
* Ladder Dispenser: This machine can place rope ladders for you! With the flip of a switch the dispenser will start placing rope ladders under itself. Flip the lever again and the machine will start to retract the ladder.
